## Introduction to GitOps

GitOps is a modern approach to managing infrastructure and application deployments that uses Git as the single source of truth. This methodology enables organizations to achieve:

- It bridges the gap between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), ensuring that deployment processes are version-controlled and auditable.

- With GitOps, you store the desired state of your system in a Git repository, and a GitOps tool ensures that the actual system state matches the desired state through automated synchronization.

- GitOps is commonly associated with Kubernetes, its principles can be applied to any infrastructure that can be described declaratively.

- While GitOps doesn't strictly require Git, its tooling and workflows are deeply aligned with Git's capabilities. Using a different VCS for GitOps is possible but might involve extra effort and customizations.

- Argo CD and Flux are two popular GitOps controllers, mainly used with Kubernetes.

## Core Principles

### 1. Declarative Configuration
- All system states (infrastructure, applications, etc.) are defined declaratively in code
- Configurations are version-controlled
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles are followed
- Common tools: Kubernetes YAML, Terraform, CloudFormation

### 2. Git as Single Source of Truth
- All system configurations are stored in Git
- Git history provides a complete audit trail
- Changes must go through Git to be applied
- Enables collaboration through pull requests

### 3. Automated Synchronization
- A GitOps operator (e.g., Flux, ArgoCD) watches the Git repositories and automatically applies changes to the system.
- Self-healing capabilities
- Automated rollbacks when needed

### 4. Continuous Verification
- Continuously reconciles the actual state with the desired state.
- Unauthorized changes are automatically reverted
- Real-time drift detection
- Built-in security controls

## ArgoCD Architecture

ArgoCD implements GitOps through a microservices architecture:

### Core Components

1. **API Server**
   - Exposes the REST API and web UI
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Manages user interactions
   - Supports SSO via OIDC

2. **Repository Server**
   - Interacts with Git repositories to fetch application manifests (desired state).
   - Monitors changes in the Git repository.
   - Performs manifest generation for configurations like Helm charts and Kustomize.

3. **Application Controller (Reconciliation Engine)**
   - Manages application state
   - Continuously monitors the desired state defined in the Git repository and the live state of the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Identifies drift (discrepancies) between the two states.
   - Synchronizes the cluster state with the desired state by applying necessary changes to the cluster.

4. **ApplicationSet Controller**
   - An ApplicationSet is a custom resource in ArgoCD that extends the functionality of the ArgoCD Application resource. 
   - While a typical ArgoCD Application is used to define a single deployment, an ApplicationSet allows you to define a set of applications, making it easier to manage applications that are similar but vary in certain configurations, like different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).

### Supporting Services

- **Dex**: Authentication service for SSO (single sign-on).
- **Redis**: Used for caching data, ensuring stateful operations and recovery in case of service restarts.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**:
    - Defines an Argo CD application (Source, Target, Sync Policies)
        - Source: The Git repository and path containing the desired application state.
        - Target: The Kubernetes cluster and namespace where the application should run.
        - Sync policies: Automatic or manual synchronization options.
    - Enables Kubernetes-native management of Argo CD applications.

## Deployment Models

### Hub-Spoke Architecture
```
[Hub Cluster]
    │
    ├── Spoke Cluster 1
    ├── Spoke Cluster 2
    └── Spoke Cluster N
```

**Advantages:**
- In the hub-spoke model, Argo CD is installed in a central "hub" cluster that manages multiple "spoke" clusters. 
- Each spoke cluster is connected to the hub cluster via a mechanism like Argo CD's Cluster API integration.
- This is particularly useful in environments where you have multiple Kubernetes clusters and want to centralize control and management.
- It's best for enterprises with complex Kubernetes setups or multi-region deployments.
- Easier governance and monitoring.

**Challenges:**
- Single point of failure: If the hub cluster becomes unavailable, managing the spoke clusters can be challenging.
- Network complexity: Increased complexity in setting up the communication between clusters.
- Permission management: Requires networking and permissions to allow access between the hub and spoke clusters.

### Standalone Architecture
```
[Cluster 1]     [Cluster 2]     [Cluster N]
    │               │               │
   ArgoCD         ArgoCD         ArgoCD
```

**Advantages:**
- In a standalone model, Argo CD is deployed within each cluster that you want to manage. Every Argo CD instance manages the resources within that cluster independently. 
- This setup is more decentralized compared to the hub-spoke model.
- Better for smaller setups or cases where each cluster operates independently. It's simpler and provides better fault isolation.
- High availability: If one Argo CD instance fails, it doesn't affect others.
- Simplicity: Each instance is responsible for a single cluster, reducing cross-cluster management complexity.
- Lower network dependencies since each cluster is autonomous.

**Challenges:**
- Harder to manage at scale: If you have many clusters, it becomes difficult to manage multiple Argo CD instances.
- Less centralized control: Each instance operates independently, so managing applications across clusters requires more coordination.
- Duplicate configuration: If you want the same applications in multiple clusters, you may need to maintain separate configurations for each Argo CD instance.

## Implementation Patterns

### GitOps Workflow

- Store Infrastructure configurations (e.g., Kubernetes YAML manifests (node.yaml, deploy.yaml) or Helm charts, or Kustomize files or Terraform files) in a Git repository.
- Set up a GitOps operator (e.g., Flux or ArgoCD) in your cluster.
- Developer makes changes to the manifests (e.g., updates an image version).
- Creates a pull request for review.
- The pull request is reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- The GitOps operator detects the change and applies it to the target system automatically.
- The operator continuously monitors and ensures that the system matches the desired state.
- If someone directly edits the cluster without Git, the GitOps controller reverts the change.

### Configuration Management Options

1. **Raw Manifests**
   - Direct YAML files
   - Simple and straightforward
   - Best for small projects

2. **Helm Charts**
   - Template-based
   - Reusable packages
   - Value overrides
   - Complex applications

3. **Kustomize**
   - Base + Overlay pattern
   - Environment-specific patches
   - Kubernetes-native
   - No templating required

## Real-World Use Cases:

- **Continuous Delivery in Kubernetes:** Automating updates for microservices hosted on Kubernetes clusters.
- **Multi-Environment Management:** Managing separate repositories for dev, staging, and production environments.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Quick rollbacks to stable states in case of failed deployments.
- **Compliance and Auditing:** Git serves as an audit log for all cluster changes.

## GitOps Tools:

- **FluxCD:** A lightweight GitOps tool for Kubernetes. Watches a Git repository and applies changes automatically.
- **ArgoCD:** A more feature-rich GitOps tool, ideal for complex Kubernetes environments. Provides a web interface and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Jenkins X:** Combines CI/CD capabilities with GitOps.
- **Spinnaker:** Primarily a deployment tool, not entirely GitOps-focused.

## GitOps for Applications and Infrastructure:

GitOps is not limited to application deployments. It is equally useful for managing infrastructure. For example:

- **Application Delivery:** Deploying services like web applications or microservices.
  - e.g; Deploying a web app using a deployment.yaml manifest.
- **Infrastructure Delivery:** Managing Kubernetes nodes, admission controllers, namespaces, etc.
  - e.g; Infrastructure Delivery: Modifying Kubernetes node configurations using a ```node.yaml``` manifest.

## Traditional vs GitOps-Approach to CICD Implementation

### Traditional Approach:

1. **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins -> Build & Unit Testing -> Static Code Analysis -> SAST -> DAST -> End-to-end Testing or Regression Testing -> Docker Image -> Docker Image scanning (using Trivy or Docker Scout) ->.
2. **Continuous Delivery:** -> Shell Script or Ansible Playbook (to create k8s manifests) -> Deployment to k8s.

Here, the scripts or ansible playbooks are not capable of identifying any manual changes in the k8s cluster. For the Continuous-Integration part, we have Git as the single source of truth. But for the Continuous-Delivery part, we have no source of truth to verify any manual changes in the cluster. 

### GitOps-Approach:

1. **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins -> Build & Unit Testing -> Static Code Analysis -> SAST -> DAST -> End-to-end Testing or Regression Testing -> Docker Image -> Docker Image scanning (using Trivy or Docker Scout) ->.
2. **Continuous Delivery:** ->  Infrastructure Configurations stored in Git repo (to create k8s manifests) -> GitOps Tool like ArgoCd (to track changes in the git repo and apply those changes to k8s cluster) -> Deployment to k8s.

Here Git is the only source of truth for both CI & CD stages.
